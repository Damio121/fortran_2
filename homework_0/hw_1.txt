Homework 1

Task 1 - Factorial overflow

My factorial function started having problems at n=21

Task 2 - Loss of significance

The small number lost significance at 3.03983683E-08


Task 3 - review

integer types suffer from overflow, while real numbers have floating point problems
i think the overflow is a much more dangerous problem in science, because it leads to BIG numerical mistakes.
But maybe I'm wrong :D
